					"I've worked with literally hundreds of HTML/CSS developers and I have to say the top spot goes to this guy. This guy is an amazing developer. He stresses on good, clean code and pays heed to the details. I love developers who respect each and every aspect of a throughly thought out design and do their best to put it in code. He goes over and beyond and transforms ART into PIXELS - without a glitch, every time"

					"I had my concerns that due to a tight deadline this project can't be done. But this guy proved me wrong not only he delivered an outstanding work but he managed to deliver 1 day prior to the deadline. And when I asked for some revisions he made them in MINUTES. I'm looking forward to work with him again and I totally recommend him. Thanks again!"
